# SULI-Program-
Code from Crystallography projects during my Science Undergraduate Labratory Internship program (Summer 2022).  
I coded the python scripts first and then remade the code in C++ while learning the language.  The C++ scipts were the final product of the program, in addition to my deliverables.  The C++ code can be found in the folder dc7unsrt
